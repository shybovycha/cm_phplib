== Installation and getting started ==

 

First of all you should sign-up for a CloudMade services and obtain a valid API key.
 
Next, get a copy of this API from Cloudmade's site (Developers section).
 
Then, install PHP5 and web-server (like Apache or nginx). Pretty good instructions on 
how to do it on
 Ubuntu/Debian system are given in HOWTOForge: 
http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_debian_lamp_server .
 When you have installed all the 
stuff needed, just unzip the archive or clone repository version to any 
 directory on 
your PC and you are ready to go.
For more info read documentation in the doc/ dir. And do not forget about examples/ one! =)
