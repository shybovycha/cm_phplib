== Installation and getting started ==



First of all you should sign-up for a CloudMade services and obtain a valid API key.

Next, get a copy of this API from Cloudmade's site (Developers section).

Then, install PHP5 and web-server (like Apache or nginx). Pretty good instructions on
how to do it on
 Ubuntu/Debian system are given in HOWTOForge:
http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_debian_lamp_server .
 When you have installed all the
stuff needed, just unzip the archive or clone repository version to any 
 directory on
your PC and you are ready to go.

 To run unit tests, you'll need to have an installed version of PHPUnit. If so, just
enter the tests/ directory and run

$ phpunit %test_file_name%

 To run examples from examples/ folder, just open this directory in your terminal and type

$ php %example_file_name%

 For this option you'll need to have php-cli package (*nix systems) installed, but it's
recommended that you to run those examples on your server and browse the results in your
web-browser.

For more info read documentation in the doc/ dir. And do not forget about examples/ one! =)
